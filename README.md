# Retail Data Analysis: Customer Retention and User Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze retail data to understand customer retention and perform user segmentation. By examining purchase behaviors and identifying distinct customer segments, we can develop targeted strategies to enhance customer retention and optimize marketing efforts.

## Dataset Features
The dataset contains the following features:

1. **order_id**: Unique identifier for each order (461,773 non-null)
2. **product_code**: Code identifying each product (451,726 non-null)
3. **product_name**: Name of the product (449,008 non-null)
4. **quantity**: Quantity of the product ordered (451,726 non-null)
5. **order_date**: Date when the order was placed (451,726 non-null)
6. **price**: Price of the product (451,726 non-null)
7. **customer_id**: Unique identifier for each customer

## Business Understanding
### Customer Retention
Customer retention is crucial for any retail business as it is often more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. By analyzing purchase data, we can identify patterns and factors that influence customer retention and develop strategies to improve it.

### User Segmentation
User segmentation involves dividing customers into distinct groups based on their behaviors and characteristics. This allows for more personalized marketing and service strategies, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Segments may be based on factors such as purchase frequency, order value, and product preferences.

## Analysis Methodology
### Customer Retention Analysis
1. **Cohort Analysis**: Group customers by their first purchase date and track their behavior over time to understand retention rates.
2. **RFM Analysis**: Evaluate customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of their purchases to identify key retention metrics.

### User Segmentation
1. **RFM SEGMENTATION**: Group customers into segments based on their purchasing behavior.


## Results
The output will include:
- Cohort analysis charts and retention metrics.
- RFM segmentation results.
- Customer segments visualizations using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding).
- Summary statistics and insights for each customer segment.
